520

He-- He's coming to Gotham?

521
00:47:12,923 --> 00:47:14,382
Yes, he is.

522
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:17,009
And when he gets here,
he's not going to wanna hear...

523
00:47:17,177 --> 00:47:22,265
...that you've endangered our operation
just to get your thugs out of jail time.

524

-There's a girl at the DA's office.

525

-Not this one.

-Why is no one answering the phone?

545

It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle.
I'm sure they'll call back.

-I understand.

Routed it right into Wayne Tower,
along with the water and power utilities.

583

593

For spelunking.

594
00:51:06,156 --> 00:51:07,448
Spelunking?

595
00:51:07,616 --> 00:51:09,325
Yeah, you know, cave diving?

596
